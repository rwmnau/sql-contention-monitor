# sql-contention-monitor

This was originally stored at Codeplex (https://mssqlblockmonitor.codeplex.com/) but that's long since offline, so I've moved it here. You're free to do with it what you want. It's about 10 years old at this point so no guarantees that it works on newer versions of SQL Server or .NET, but you're welcome to give it a try.
